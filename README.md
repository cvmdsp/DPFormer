#DPFormer
The steps for using the DPFormer code are as follows:
1. Data Preprocessing:
Create two folders named "HSI" and "RGB" in both the "Train" and "Test" directories. Put the training and testing images into the corresponding "Train" and "Test" folders, where HSI refers to HR-HSI (GT), and MSI refers to HR-MSI.
2. Model Training:
Directly run the Train.py file.
3. Model Testing:
Create the folder "\Result\f4\DPFormer" and run the Test.py file.
