The steps for using the MIMO-SST code are as follows:
1. Data Preprocessing:
Put the training and testing images into the corresponding "Train" and "Test" folders, where HSI refers to HR-HSI (GT), and MSI refers to HR-MSI.
2. Model Training:
Directly run the Train.py file.
3. Model Testing:
Directly run the Test.py file.
